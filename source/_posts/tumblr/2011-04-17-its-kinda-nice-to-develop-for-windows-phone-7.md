cause I had nothing better to do and [MIX11](http://live.visitmix.com/) just
ended, I tried to build a little app for WP7. nothing new just a local app
which does the same as my sinatra app [News Filter](http://hm.eger-andreas.de)
for the bulletin board at Hochschule MÃ¼nchen
([source](https://github.com/sch1zo/hm-news-filter))

So, first a word or two the the language C# and Silverlight. It wasn't the
first time for me to use C# but it was almost a year ago since my last use,
but C# is not so different to Java so it was no problem to get into it again.
Silverlight on the other hand was new to me and I had to search a little bit
to find the right methods to use, but also no problem.

The development tools are awesome, Visual Studio 2010, great emulator and nice
application templates which let you start right into the app without having to
build all basic controls. So my only problem was to find the right libraries
and controls to make do the work.

But lacking a device with WP7 I don't think i will do much at the moment,
perhaps later this year with the Mango SDK. Also I will have a look at the new
devices in fall.
