just release my first gem on rubygems
[redis_storage](https://rubygems.org/gems/redis_storage) I wanted to call it
redis_record but their already is a gem with that name.

Its a redis interface for storing models in redis - or to be more exact
storing there attributes as json.

<!-- more -->

Basically I just got sick rewriting the same logic over and over again for
each model of my little sinatra apps so this evolved. Then I wanted to write a
new rails app an thought having this in a gem would be really nice, and a
generator would be awesome.

If you interested check it out on
