for one thing I just want to test if email publishing works as expected, for
another thing I just realized how long it is ago since the last time I really
used c++.

I have to use it for a project in one of my courses and I both _hate_ to use
it and _like_ to get into it again. It's just so different compared to
something like Java or even Ruby.

In the lecture we formed a project team and develop a automatic jigsaw puzzle
solver. Besides a team who analyses the puzzle pieces and one which presents
and animates the puzzle and the puzzle solving I'm in the team which tries to
solve the puzzle with the provided data from team one. I'm really curious if
we can manage to solve something like a 1000 piece puzzle.
