over the last weeks I had to create a GUI in Java with three other fellow
students. It was part of one of our courses which is about Graphical User
Interfaces and after creating wireframes and a design concept we only had
three weeks time to implement all of it, including parsers for _nine_ files -
a few of them were xml but not the nice kind of xml - and a configuration
file.

We didn't had time to make any kind of project plan or even a software design.
We had to code fast to get all aspects working in time. Everybody simply got a
few pieces to implement and at the end we somehow hacked it together. We
managed to get most of it and it worked as desired but the codebase itself is
a mess.

On the one hand its simple because Java and Swing IMHO always produces messy
code but of cause the main reason was probably just because we just hacked
things together to get them working.

At least we made sure that nobody will ever want to use our code for there
projects.
