    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>…and I love it.</p>

<p>I have to admit that it took me really long before I took the step to use vim.
Before I used the typical graphical editors(like gedit/sublime_text) to write
my code. Full fledged IDE where not really preferred way of coding, but till
now I ad least needed my mouse to do some fancy editing stuff. I knew how the
basic controlls in vi are but felt awkward to use them, so most of the time
when I needed a terminal editor I used nano.</p>

<p>Then, last week I made another approach to use vim and the first thing I did
was getting a really good .vimrc - like most of this stuff I found a package
on github <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">janus</a>. The other thing I did
was not trying to use all the crazy stuff in vim from the get go and instead
just use the stuff I already knew a just add new tricks when I thought <strong>hey,
there has to be a better/fancier/faster way to do this</strong></p>

<p>Now after using vim like this I don't want to go back to another editor and I
just know the tip of the iceberg. There much more vim magic to learn. Only for
one thing I still like a graphical editor like sublime_text and thats for
browsing code, just looking at various source files without the need of
changing it or even copying parts.</p>
