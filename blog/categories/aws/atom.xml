    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was surfing around and once again I got that ugly GEMA message on a
youtube music video which prevented me from watching it. In the last months
more and more videos got blocked this way and makes having a german IP a pain.</p>

<p>But than I remembered that I can set up a Micro Instance in one of the US
datacentrers and route my web traffic through it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So what are my options to do this?</p>

<ul>
<li>setting up a proxy server on that instance</li>
<li>establish a ssh tunnnel and use that as local proxy</li>
<li>set up a VPN server on the instance and use that to reroute my traffic</li>
</ul>


<p>Because I don't like having to set a proxy in each and every browser and app I
have and than always having to keep my tunnel open I decided to look into the
VPN solution. After all I can fall back to the tunnel at any time - for
example if I need to connect to another VPN and still want to use a US IP or
if I want to be connected to one of my other servers without having the signal
bounce to the US and back.</p>

<p>After deleting my existing instance(which was at the european data center) I
looked at the available Community AMIs. One of them was called <strong>OpenVPN
Access Server</strong> and after looking at the related site I thought this is
exactly what I wanted and is free for 2 concurrent users. Theres also a
<a href="http://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/docs/admin-guides/499%0A-openvpn-access-server-ami.html">guide</a> on their site which describes how to make the
initial setup. And even better it perfectly fits in the Free Tier Plan.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I could nowhere find what the user is with which I can connect
via ssh to the instance. After some more searching and trying I figured its
the user <strong>ubuntu</strong> - nice of them to mention that nowhere in the guide.</p>

<p>But even without even having to connect a single time via SSH to the instance
it had started a nice webUI with full Admin interface and everything you need
to connect to the VPN. It even offers pre-configured OpenVPN Clients for
Windows and Mac and a guide for Unix.</p>

<p>So now all I have to do is tell the OpenVPN Client to connect to my instance
and I'm good to go. Now I just have to keep a look at my monthly traffic -
there are <em>only</em> 15GB in and 15GB out in the Free Tier Plan. Could become a
problem considering the fact I now have access to hulu/pandora and others.</p>

<p>This usage doesn't has anything to do with my initial plan to explore the
cloud but an EC2 instance is basically just a virtual server with some
additional services strapped on. Still I will look into the other services of
the Free Tier Plan. I'm especially interested in the SimpleDB service,
unfortunately only 25 <em>machine hours</em> are free per month - whatever they mean
with machine hour. There are more <em>more cloudy</em> things I have in mind and will
test at some point.</p>

<p>PS: I also found a really nice monthly activities page for your account, shows
exactly what and how much of it you used and how much it costs.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>after getting the EC2 Instance up and running its time to install a basic
development environment.</p>

<ul>
<li>zsh and screen makes as expected no problems.</li>
<li>vim is unfortunately not compiled with ruby and I couldn't find another one in the repository so it has to work without it</li>
<li>rvm again no problem. As I'm writing this post ruby 1.9.2 is compiling, which given the power of a micro instance is slow perhaps to slow to do anything with it, but time will see.</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<p>Next time setting up such a machine it may be no bad idea to get a bigger
instance for a few hours, just to make the compiling faster.</p>

<p>What surprised me was how minimal the installed linux were, no unnecessary
packages just the stuff I want.</p>

<p>Next steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>compiling nginx (with passenger) - this could take a while given the speed of the instance</li>
<li>running a few of my small sinatra and rails apps</li>
<li>will this instance be fast enough to do development?</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>so out of curiosity I just registered for <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web
Services</a> and my plan is to just use the free tier
Amazon provides <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free">link</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Right now after about half an hour I have my first micro instance up and it
runs <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/">Amazon Linux (Beta)</a>. Thats a
maintained and supported Linux image which just fits in the free tier plan. As
far as I can tell it has its background in the Red Hat camp and uses yum as
package manager.</p>

<p>The Management Console is at first glance is nice but you definitely have to
get the hang of it. There's many stuff to configure and setup, but more on
that later.</p>

<p>First downer: I couldn't get the Archlinux images running, will have to look
into that at some point.</p>

<p>Another weird thing is that once you are in the management console your not
really have control over your costs, but at least when you create a new
instance it will show you if it will fit in the free plan.</p>

<p>Next Steps are</p>

<ul>
<li>install zsh, vim, screen, ruby - rvm</li>
<li>make the necessary setup for the above (basically import my rc files)</li>
<li>watch how the micro instance performs</li>
</ul>
