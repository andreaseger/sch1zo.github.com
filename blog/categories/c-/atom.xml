    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>yesterday I had to install <a href="http://www.imagemagick.com">ImageMagick</a> to do
some image processing on a new webapp I'm building - creating thumbnails of
uploaded images to be precise.</p>

<p>The initial choice was to simply use the the package from the repository. But
it was unbarable slow to simply create a 100x100 thumbnail of a 1080p
wallpaper which I used to test it( time sad a little above 7 seconds).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So the logical next step was to get the source and compile ImageMagick by
hand. But I didn't stopped there. After a quick search I found some tips to
get it even faster:</p>

<ul>
<li>first lets mess around with the compiler optimization I found <a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/AppPerfTuning/ImageMagick">here</a> but I did not change the CC CXX or CFLAGS instead I only modified CXXFLAGS</li>
</ul>


<p>export CXXFLAGS = "-g0 -fast -zlazyload"</p>

<ul>
<li>make it use only about half the memory configure with with-quantum-depth=8 instead of the default 16</li>
</ul>


<p>./configure --with-quantum-depth=8</p>

<p>If this gives you a snappy imagemagick your fine, but on my ubuntu server a
simple resize still took 7 seconds.</p>

<p>So I did a little bit more searching and found out that a buggy OpenMP can
cause this issue and disabling it while compiling fixes the slowness.</p>

<p><strong>Finally here my complete configure line</strong></p>

<p><code>sh
./configure CXX="g++" CXXFLAGS="-g0 -fast -zlazyload" --with-quantum-depth=8 --disable-openmp
</code></p>

<p>I know this post is a mess, but I dont care</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ok thats nothing new, yet the difference was a little bit surprising.</p>

<p>In an earlier post I described the <em>puzzleSolver</em> project and before starting
to implement parts of it in c++ I build a Ruby prototype. The prototype
generated 1000 random puzzle pieces and later generated a quality between
every 4000 puzzle edges, thats about 8.000.000 calculations. The Ruby
Prototype needs <strong>3 minutes</strong> to finish that calculation.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The c++ version does exactly the same, it has the same structure and
algorithm. Now the calculations are done in <strong>under 1 second</strong> for 1000
pieces.</p>

<p>As I sad, its not surprising that the c++ version is way faster than the Ruby
prototype. But a difference of <strong>200 times faster</strong> was surprising.</p>

<p>But I don't want to make Ruby bad, I love Ruby, without the prototype it would
have been way more difficult to build the c++ version. And of cause the time
building the two versions where different, the Ruby prototype was working
within a few hours, plus another few to optimize the algorithm. The c++
version toke a few days till it was working like the prototype, but that might
also had to do that my last c++ encounter was like two years ago. But even so
I just had to re implement the existing algorithm. Without that it would have
taken even longer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>for one thing I just want to test if email publishing works as expected, for
another thing I just realized how long it is ago since the last time I really
used c++.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I have to use it for a project in one of my courses and I both <em>hate</em> to use
it and <em>like</em> to get into it again. It's just so different compared to
something like Java or even Ruby.</p>

<p>In the lecture we formed a project team and develop a automatic jigsaw puzzle
solver. Besides a team who analyses the puzzle pieces and one which presents
and animates the puzzle and the puzzle solving I'm in the team which tries to
solve the puzzle with the provided data from team one. I'm really curious if
we can manage to solve something like a 1000 piece puzzle.</p>
