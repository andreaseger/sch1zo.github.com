    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have one last post regarding my plan to reroute certain web traffic through
my server.</p>

<p>This post maybe should have been the first in this little series, because I
will show you how to setup a SOCKS proxy to your server.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Putty</h2>

<p>I'd like to think that you already have a session which connects to your
server via ssh. Load this session and go in the menu to the item
<strong>Connection</strong> -> <strong>SSH</strong> -> <strong>Tunnels</strong>.</p>

<p>Enter the portnumber of your choice into the field <strong>Source Port</strong> for example
1234.</p>

<p>Than select <em>Dynamic</em> and <em>Auto</em> and click <strong>Add</strong>. You will now see <strong>D1234</strong>
in the list above.</p>

<p>You can now go back the the sessions screen, save your changes and open the
connection.</p>

<h2>unix</h2>

<p>for unix it is quite simple</p>

<pre><code>ssh -ND 1234 user@server.com
</code></pre>

<p>This will open a SOCKS proxy on port 1234 to the server. <strong>-N</strong> Tells prevents
the console from executing any remote command. This way it will just open the
tunnel and than sits there and waits for you to close it (with CTRL+C) later.
With an additional <strong>-f</strong> it is also possible to completely background the
process, but than its not as easy for you to close the tunnel later.</p>
